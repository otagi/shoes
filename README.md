# Shoes — a Hovercards with StimulusJS sample app

This is a rendition of Matt Swanson’s [Hovercards article](https://boringrails.com/articles/hovercards-stimulus/) code, with the HTML and CSS part adapted to use a semantic syntax.

The app is a companion to the [Semantic Hovercards](https://www.mendes-costa.net/posts/semantic-hovercards) article.
